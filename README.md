## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   cd odoo-development
   ```

2. Open your preferred Odoo version in VSCode:
   ```bash
   code 16.0  # For Odoo 16
   code 17.0  # For Odoo 17
   code 18.0  # For Odoo 18
   code 19.0  # For Odoo 19
   ```

3. When prompted, select "Reopen in Container" or use the Command Palette (F1):
   - Choose "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"

4. After the initial container build:
   - Access Odoo: http://localhost:80xx (xx = version number)
   - Access Mailpit: http://localhost:81xx (xx = 16/17/18/19)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Gemini CLI Authentication

This development environment supports flexible authentication for the Gemini CLI, allowing you to use either a Google API Key for direct access or integrate with Google Cloud's Vertex AI.

### Environment Variables (.env file)

To manage your authentication credentials and Google Cloud project details, a `.env` file is used. This file is ignored by Git (`.gitignore`) to prevent sensitive information from being committed.

1.  **Create your `.env` file**: Copy the provided `.env.example` file to `.env` in the root of this project:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Configure your `.env` file**: Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the relevant details:
    ```ini
    # .env
    # Your Google Cloud Project ID for Vertex AI access
    GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-google-cloud-project-id"

    # Your Google Cloud location/region for Vertex AI (e.g., us-central1)
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="your-google-cloud-location"

    # Path to your Google Cloud Service Account JSON key file on the host machine
    GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"

    # Your Google API Key for direct Gemini API access (optional)
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
    ```
    *   **`GCP_PROJECT_ID`**, **`GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`**, and **`GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE`** are needed if you plan to use Vertex AI.
    *   **`GOOGLE_API_KEY`** is an alternative if you prefer direct Gemini API access.

### Authentication Methods

You can choose between two primary methods for Gemini CLI authentication:

#### 1. Using a Service Account (Recommended for Vertex AI)

This method uses a Google Cloud Service Account JSON key file for robust and persistent authentication. It is the **recommended** approach for using Vertex AI.

1.  **Create and Download a Service Account Key**:
    *   In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
    *   Create a new service account or select an existing one.
    *   Grant it the necessary roles (e.g., "Vertex AI User").
    *   Create a new JSON key and download it to a secure location on your host machine.

2.  **Configure `.env`**:
    *   Set `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` in your `.env` file.
    *   Set `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` to the absolute path of the downloaded JSON key file on your host machine.

3.  **Rebuild Your Container**: If the container is already running, you'll need to rebuild it for the changes to take effect. In VSCode, you can use the command "Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container".

4.  **Configure Gemini CLI (Inside Container)**:
    *   Open a terminal *inside your dev container* and start Gemini CLI: `gemini`
    *   Use the `/auth` command and select **Google Vertex AI**. Gemini CLI will automatically use the service account credentials mounted into the container.

#### 2. Using a Google API Key (Direct Gemini API Access)

This method is simpler if you only need direct access to the Gemini API without the full Vertex AI platform features.

1.  **Obtain an API Key**: Generate a Google API Key from the Google Cloud Console.
2.  **Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY`**: Add your API key to the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` variable in your `.env` file.
3.  **Usage**: Gemini CLI will automatically pick up this API key.

#### 3. Using `gcloud auth application-default login` (Legacy Method)

This method is now considered **outdated** but remains available for users who prefer not to use service accounts. It relies on credentials generated on the host machine.

1.  **Authenticate `gcloud` on Host**:
    *   Install the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) on your host machine.
    *   Run `gcloud auth application-default login`. This stores credentials in `~/.config/gcloud`.
2.  **Limitation**: This method can lead to sessions that expire, requiring you to re-authenticate periodically. The service account method is more stable for long-term development.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

   - Module creation in workspace directory
   - Configured addons path
   - Python hot-reload support

2. **Database Management**
